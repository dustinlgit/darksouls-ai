Inspirations:
- [Black Myth Unified](https://jack-emerald.github.io/BlackMyth-Unified_Mind/index.html) is a past group that tackled another "soulslike" game, giving us the inspiration for this project
- [Omni's Hackpad](https://badecho.com/index.php/2020/09/25/hacking-dark-souls-iii-part-1/) for giving us the idea to extract features directly from memory instead of through frame data
